# REACT

React is a JavaScript library created and (mostly) maintained by Facebook (Meta).
React is a JavaScript library for building User Interfaces.

## Intro

- React is a JavaScript library for building User Interfaces.
- React is only responsible for the View layer.
- React is not a framework.

## Installation

- Install react with npm install react
- Import React in every file you need it with import React from "react"
- Get the current React version with React.version
- React weighs 7KB when imported.

## React.CreateElement

- A React Element is the smallest building block.
- It's a representation of a small piece of your UI.
- React.createElement returns a React Element
- React.createElement(type, options, children)

## ReactDOM

- ReactDOM is the glue between React and the DOM.
- ReactDOM is separate from React because you can write React for native applications.
- Reconciliation is the process of syncing the Virtual DOM to the actual DOM.
- Install ReactDOM with npm install react-dom
- Import ReactDOM's render method with import {render} from "react-dom"

## Root Element

- The root element is completely managed by ReactDOM
- You should not directly change/update the content of the root element
- Apps built with React have a single root element (Most common use case)
- Existing Apps that integrate React to make a feature interactive, could have more than 1 root.

## JSX

- JSX is a special syntax for React that makes it easier to represent your UI
- JSX looks similar to HTML but it is not HTML
- JSX code you write gets transformed into React.createElement
- JSX is not part of your browser. You need a tool to transform it to valid JavaScript.
- JSX requires React to be in scope.
- Attributes in JSX get passed as the 2nd argument of React.createElement(...)
- <div className="active"></div> is how you would give the class active to this element.
- You need quotes around attribute values that are strings.
- A JSX element is an object
- you can treat a JSX element like an object
- you can assign a JSX element to a variable
- you can return a JSX element from a function
- Use self-closing syntax for self-closing elements in JSX

## JSX Expressions

- An expression is any valid JavaScript code that resolves to a value
- Expressions in JSX need to be wrapped inside curly braces: {expression}
- {2 + 3} is an example of JSX with an expression.
- If the value of the attribute is a string, then wrap it with quotes
- If the value of the attribute is an expression, then wrap it with curly braces {}
- Number and boolean attribute values should be passed as an expression

## JSX Children

- JSX supports children
- Always wrap your JSX elements with () when written after a return.

## JSX Fragments

- You can only return 1 element in JSX
- Wrap multiple elements with React.Fragment
- The short syntax is <> that can be closed with </>
- The original syntax is: <React.Fragment> and </React.Fragment>

## Components

- A React Component is a function that returns one React Element describing a section of the UI.
- Components defined with a function are called function components.
- React Components promote code reuse and are easier to debug.
- A React Component's name has to start with an uppercase.
- Use UpperCamelCase when naming React Components
